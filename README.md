# eye-data

(EyeData-> right eye) && (EyeDataLeft-> left eye):
- `data.txt` and `data_left.txt` contains coordinates of the eye and pupil for the right and left eyes respectively.
- the images are in order only (the coordinates for the first eye image are the first value in `data.txt`, not the initial value, after that)
